      "summary": "Mischievous creatures blamed for mechanical and technological failures, originating from 1920s-1940s aviation folklore, especially among WWII RAF pilots.",
      "full": "Gremlins are small, imp-like creatures from modern folklore that are blamed for causing mechanical and technological malfunctions, particularly in aircraft. Originating in Royal Air Force folklore during the 1920s-1940s, gremlins became especially popular during World War II when pilots blamed unexplained mechanical failures on these invisible or barely visible saboteurs. Described as small creatures (6 inches to 3 feet tall) with various appearances—often green or gray with large ears—gremlins evolved from aviation folklore into a broader explanation for any technological failure. Popularized by Roald Dahl's 1943 book 'The Gremlins' and the 1984 film, they represent the personification of mechanical failure and human error displacement in the modern age."
